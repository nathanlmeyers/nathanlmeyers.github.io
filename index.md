I am a data generalist and have worked as the first data hire at a bunch of small startups. Most recently, I was the senior data scientist at [WAIR](https://getwair.com/). I have previously worked as a data scientist at Stackin' (a now defunct financial literacy platform), OpenLattice (a government tech startup that has since shut down), and [Bevi](https://www.bevi.co/) (a sparkling water machine startup that is still going strong). Before working in tech, I was a graduate student in Applied Mathematics at the [Brown University Division of Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/) where I was part of the [Serre Lab](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/). My interests include statistics, probability, graphical models, and deep learning.
