I am currently a senior data scientist at [WAIR](https://getwair.com/). I have previously worked as a data scientist at a few small startups: [Stackin'](https://stackin.com/), [OpenLattice](https://openlattice.com/), and [Bevi](https://www.bevi.co/). Before working in tech, I was a graduate student in Applied Mathematics at the [Brown University Division of Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/) where I was part of the [Serre Lab](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/). My interests include statistics, probability, graphical models, and deep learning.
