I am currently a senior data scientist at [Stackin'](https://stackin.com/). I was previously a data scientist at [OpenLattice](https://openlattice.com/) and the first data scientist at [Bevi](https://www.bevi.co/) after finishing my masters in Applied Mathematics at the [Brown University Division of Applied Mathematics](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/) where I was part of the [Serre Lab](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/). My interests include statistics, probability, graphical models, and deep learning.
